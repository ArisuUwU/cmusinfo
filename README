CMUSINFO

What it does:
Outputs the cmus players status and the currently playing song.
Displays album art through mpv.
Sends notifications when the song changes.

Notable features:
If a song has embedded album art, it will use that songs album art
instead of album art that may be found in the folder.

The -n / --notify flag enables notifications in mpv. Meaning that, when
the song changes, text will appear with the songs information. Useful
for when mpv is in fullscreen.

If a song is not properly tagged with the artist and title, it will
use the file name without the extension instead.

Dependencies:
cmus
bash
coreutils

mpv (Album Art)
ffmpeg (Album Art)
socat (Album Art)
libnotify-bin (Desktop Notifications)
